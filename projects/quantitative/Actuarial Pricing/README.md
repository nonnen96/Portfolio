# Actuarial Pricing – Auto Insurance

**Modeling claim frequency and severity for auto insurance portfolios**

## Description

This project focuses on **insurance pricing** for auto policies using advanced statistical modeling techniques. The main objectives are to accurately model claim frequency and severity, select relevant risk factors, and implement robust regression techniques.

Key elements of the project include:

- Modeling **claim frequency** with Poisson GLMs and **claim severity** with Gamma GLMs.  
- Selection of explanatory variables to improve predictive performance.  
- Implementation of **penalized regressions** (Lasso/Ridge) for model regularization.  
- Data preprocessing, feature engineering, and handling of exposures.  
- Evaluation of model accuracy and goodness-of-fit for pricing purposes.

**Output:**  
- Project notebook ([NB](Actuarial%20Pricing%20Project.ipynb))  
- Detailed report ([PDF](Actuarial%20Pricing%20Projet%20Report.pdf))
