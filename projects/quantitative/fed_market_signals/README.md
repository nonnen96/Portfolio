# Fed Market Signals – NLP & Machine Learning

**Quantifying the impact of Federal Reserve communication intensity on market volatility**

## Description

This project investigates how the intensity of Federal Reserve communications affects financial market volatility. Specifically, we explore whether excessive communication leads to a saturation effect, where markets become less sensitive to new messages, reducing their impact, a phenomenon we refer to as *resonance*.

Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques, the objectives are:

- Collect and preprocess Federal Reserve communications (speeches, press releases, meeting minutes).  
- Extract linguistic and sentiment features using NLP techniques.  
- Quantify the market’s reaction and potential saturation effects.  
- Model the relationship between communication intensity and volatility metrics like the VIX.

All the code and explanations are included in the notebook, which contains the full scraping pipeline and the package loading/installation steps required to run the analysis.

**Output:** Jupyter notebook ([NB](ML%20Project%20-%20FED%20speeches.ipynb))
